## Step 1: Prepare Your Hair
 
Before using the Manual Strands S68 45 hair straightener, you need to make sure your hair is clean, dry, and free of tangles. You can wash your hair with a shampoo and conditioner that suit your hair type, and then blow-dry it with a round brush or a paddle brush. Alternatively, you can let your hair air-dry naturally if you have enough time. You should also apply a heat protectant spray or serum to your hair to prevent damage from the high temperature of the straightener.
 
## Step 2: Plug in and Turn on the Device
 
Next, you need to plug in the Manual Strands S68 45 hair straightener to a power outlet and press the power button to turn it on. You will see a blue LED light on the handle indicating that the device is on. You can then use the + and - buttons to adjust the temperature according to your preference. The device has a range of temperature settings from 140Â°F to 450Â°F, and it will display the current temperature on the LCD screen. You can refer to the user manual for the recommended temperature for your hair type.
 
## Step 3: Section Your Hair
 
Once the device reaches your desired temperature, you can start sectioning your hair into small and manageable pieces. You can use clips or elastic bands to secure the sections that you are not working on. The size of each section will depend on the thickness and length of your hair, but generally, you should aim for sections that are about one inch wide and half an inch thick.
 
## Step 4: Straighten Your Hair
 
Now you are ready to straighten your hair with the Manual Strands S68 45 hair straightener. You should start from the back of your head and work your way to the front. To straighten each section, you need to place it between the plates of the device and gently clamp down. Then, you need to slide the device slowly from the roots to the ends of your hair. You should avoid holding the device on one spot for too long, as this can cause damage or burns. You can repeat this process until all sections of your hair are straightened.
 
## Step 5: Finish Your Style
 
After you have straightened all of your hair, you can turn off the device and unplug it from the power outlet. You should let it cool down completely before storing it away. You can also apply some finishing products to your hair, such as a shine spray or a hairspray, to add some extra gloss and hold to your style. You can also use a comb or a brush to smooth out any flyaways or frizz.
 
## Conclusion
 
The Manual Strands S68 45 hair straightener is a versatile and easy-to-use tool that can help you achieve salon-quality results at home. By following these simple steps, you can create smooth and sleek styles in minutes with this device. However, you should always use caution when using any heat styling device, and follow the safety instructions provided by the manufacturer. You should also take good care of your hair by using appropriate products and treatments to keep it healthy and shiny.
